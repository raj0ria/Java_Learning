What it is?
LSP states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

Why it is used?
It ensures that a subclass can stand in for its superclass without causing unexpected behavior.

How it helps?
It helps in maintaining the integrity of the system by ensuring that subclasses are substitutable for their base classes.
